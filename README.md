# Circle and Hexagon Experiment

🎨 A responsive webpage with four colorful circles in the corners and a rotating hexagon in the center that changes colors on resize.

## Technologies Used

🛠️ HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Getting Started

🚀 To run the webpage locally, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

💻 The webpage should load with four circles in the corners, a hexagon in the center, and boxes on either side of the hexagon displaying the window size and a random word, respectively. When you resize the window, the circles will change colors and the hexagon will rotate and change colors accordingly.

## Customization

🎨 The following parameters can be customized in the `style.css` file:

- `--circle-size`: the size of the circles in the corners, specified in `vw`.
- `--hexagon-size`: the size of the hexagon in the center, specified in `vw`.
- `--hexagon-border-width`: the width of the hexagon's border, specified in `px`.

📝 The following parameters can be customized in the `script.js` file:

- `maxNumber`: the maximum number displayed in the window size box.
- `words.json`: the file containing the random words.

## Decorations

🎉 Here are some decorations you can add to the webpage:

- Add some text inside the hexagon, such as a logo or a message.
- Add some animations to the circles and/or the hexagon, such as pulsing or bouncing.
- Add some background images or patterns to the page to give it some texture.
- Add some hover effects to the circles and/or hexagon, such as changing their color or opacity on hover.
- Add some custom fonts to the page to give it a unique look.
- Add some more boxes or elements around the hexagon to create a more complex layout.
- Add some social media icons or links to the page to encourage sharing.
- Add some sound effects or music to the page to enhance the user experience.
